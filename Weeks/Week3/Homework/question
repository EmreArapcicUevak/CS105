Create a class named Pizza that stores information about a single pizza. It should contain the following:
Private instance variables to store the size of the pizza (either small, medium, or large),
the number of cheese toppings and the number of pepperoni toppings.
NOTE: number of cheese toppings, pepperoni toppings cannot be a negative number.
Constructor that sets all of the instance variables.
Public methods to get and set the instance variables
A public method named calcCost( ) that returns a double that is the cost of the pizza.
Pizza cost is determined by:
Small: $10 + $2 per topping
Medium: $12 + $2 per topping
Large: $14 + $2 per topping 
A public method named getDescription() that returns a String containing the pizza size, quantity of each topping, and the pizza cost as calculated by calcCost()
Appropriate toString and equals methods
Write main method in a class called PizzaTest that asks for pizza size and number of toppings for each category.
It should then initialize Pizza class (i.e. create an object of type Pizza) and invoke getDescription() method; NOTE: you may ask the user to input these values, or you may just invoke a constructor by entering the values yourself.
In case you want to ask the user for input you may use the code or similar code as below:

Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.print("Enter the size of Pizza:");
String size = input.nextLine();
System.out.print("Enter the number of Cheese toppings:");
int nOfCheTop = input.nextInt();
System.out.print("Enter the number of Pepperoni toppings:");
int nOfPepTop = input.nextInt();   

Also test the toString and equals methods
INCLUDE A PRINT SCREEN OF THE OUTPUT!
